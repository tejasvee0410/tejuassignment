    "Three data types are as follows :\n",
    "1) List : It store all types of items in [].It may integer,boolean,floating or string type.List are mutable so we can do change           in it.The items in list are stored index wise.so using indexing operation we can access any individual item and using           slicing operation we can extract items.we can also add list,tuple,dict into list.In python list has many in-built               function like pop,remove,append etc.\n",

    "            For slicing operation l[lower bound : upper bound : jump number]\n",
    "            \n",
    "2) Tuples : Tuples also store all types of items like list in ().Tuples are immutable means we can't make change in it.Like                 list in tuples we can extract items using slicing operation.In tuples also we can use indexing operation for                   accessing individual item.Tuples has two in-built function index and count.Tuple can also contain                               list,dict,string,tuple in it.\n",

    "            For slicing operation t[lower bound : upper bound : jump number]\n",
    "            \n",
    "3) Dict : Dict consist of unique key and value pair.It write as {\"key\" : \"value\"}.Dict are mutable so we can change values of             keys.we can use immutable data type as a key like tuples,string and for value we can use both mutable and immutable             data type.we can access value individually.In dict value is unhasable mean we can change it during program.Dict also           has many in-built function like pop,value,key etc.\n",
    "     Ex. :   d = {\"htryr\":(34,56,\"gtrg\"),\"name\":\"iNeuron\",(45,False,\"RGRRE\"):[\"HTRG\",\"345456\",65768]}\n",
